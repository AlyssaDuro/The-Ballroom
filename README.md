# The-Ballroom
A 3rd Year Project for my Creative Development Class! Future Updates will be posted here!!!

Controls:

WASD+Space to Move Player
A/D to flip through dialogue options.
Enter to SELECT that choice.
Space to read through dialogue.
Click through on interaction buttons.

**Currently only the Windows platform is available on GitHub (the file size was too big to upload here)... 

HOWEVER.
Windows AND Mac builds are available in the following google drive...

Current Game Status: It does work. To some extent. Bit better than before, as well. 

Updates:
Dialogue Options and Choices are somewhat working. 
Text is a bit botched and needs patching... (Some choices will lock up the game due to a discrepancy in the scripting)
Buttons ARE working though.
